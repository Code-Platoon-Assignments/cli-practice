# Command Line Practice

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is the command line?

* How do you open it on your computer?

* How can you navigate into a particular file directory?
    - Where will `cd .` navigate you to?
    - Where will `cd ..` navigate you to?
    - Where will `cd ~` navigate you to?
    - Where will `cd /` navigate you to?


* How can you display the name of the directory you are currently in?

* How can you display the contents of the directory you are currently in?

* How can you create a new directory?

* How can you create a new file?

* How can you destroy a directory or file?

* How can you rename a directory or file?

## Assignment:

1. Complete the first 2 sections of this interactive Codecademy course to get a great handle on navigating and manipulating directories and files [command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line). Note: you will need to set up a Codecademy account for this but this will be simple if you just link it to your Github account (the octo-cat icon when prompted to sign up).

2. Complete the below exercise locally on your own computer.

## Exercise:

In this exercise you will practice creating files and directories and deleting them.

1. Navigate to your home directory (`~`)
1. Create a new directory in your home directory and  name it `test`
2. Navigate into the `test` directory
3. Create a new file called `test.txt` using the `touch` command
4. Open this file with VSCode (from the command line) and give it some content, and then save
5. From within the cli view the contents of the file you just created (`head`, `tail`, `less`)
4. Navigate back out of the `test` directory
5. Delete the `test` directory and all files within it
